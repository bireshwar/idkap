<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read the title of the selection carefully. Determine what clues it gives you as to what the selection is about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch for keywords like “causes,” “results,” “effects,” etc., and do not overlook signal words such as those suggesting controversy (“versus”, “pros and cons”), which indicate that the author is planning to present both sides of an argument.</span></p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Learn How To Speed Read - Best Speed Reading Techniques" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xiTK523Ot5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look carefully at the headings and other organizational clues. These will tip you off to the main points that the author wants you to learn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be accustomed to overlooking boldface headings and titles which are the obvious clues to the most important ideas. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skip that material, which is not suitable for your purpose. While the author may have thought particular information was relevant, his/her reason for writing was not necessarily the same as your reason for reading. Remember to keep your reading attack flexible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, you’ll be able to read a book in much less time.</span></p>
