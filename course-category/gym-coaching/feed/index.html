										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p>The entire bodyweight workout, although intense, only took 15 minutes!</p>
<p>I know it sounds absolutely crazy, and trust me&#8230;I also thought they were absolutely bonkers when it was laid out on the table, but you just can&#8217;t argue with results. And as you saw in my own personal experience, those 15 minutes is all you need to whip yourself into incredible shape.</p>
<p>These exercises work much better than weights, and a zillion times better than cardiovascular equipment. Although the routine is intense, the exercises are fun, quick, and energizing.</p>
<p>And since you are using your own body weight, you never have to worry about injury, overtraining, or best of all&#8230;ever needing to waste another dollar or wait online for machines at a gym.</p>
<p>That eighth week, when I showed up back at my coach&#8217;s Judo school to resume training, I received some startling news.</p>
<p>Although my coach slapped me on the back and congratulated me on my personal success using the program, he informed that the American public would never see it implemented.</p>
<p>It turns out that only a week after we returned from Japan, he had received an official phone call from the Japanese training center.</p>
<p>So impressed were the Japanese officials who attended the demonstration that they completely changed their minds about the &#8220;American Judo problem&#8221; and decided to only reveal the program to their own professional and Olympic athletes.</p>
<p>In typical Japanese snobbery, they felt that the program was too good&#8230;Too Powerful&#8230; to share with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>(And four years later, at the Athens 2004 Olympics, their incredibly dominating Gold medal performance in both men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s&#8217; Judo, Wrestling, Swimming, and (most surprisingly) the Hammer Throw&#8230;proved it.)</p>
<p>All the Japanese affiliated Judo schools that attended were threatened with everything from lawsuits to being thrown out of the Judo federation and their status revoked if they taught the program to their American students. (Or for that matter, any other nationality besides Japanese citizens as well)</p>
<p>Oh well, I thought. Sucks for Judo&#8230;BUT GREAT FOR ME!!!</p>
<p>I had no ties, no affiliation, and most importantly, no loyalty to the Japanese government.</p>
<p>If I wanted to teach my fellow Americans these training secrets that had been perfected in the lab and proven in competition, there was not a damn thing they could do to stop me&#8230;</p>
<p>If you are serious about changing your body&#8230;If you want enormous strength, tightly defined muscles, a massive chest, slender waist, powerful arms and legs, and the attention and benefits of being a walking, living comic book superhero, I can make it happen faster and easier than you ever imagined possible. But not necessarily without hard work.</p>
<p>Remember, the approach I will reveal to you requires only 15 minutes each day, but it does require you to use that time far differently than you could ever imagine.</p>
<p>I can honestly give my word that you will see undeniable increases in your muscle size, strength and appearance &#8212; a total body change &#8211;within the first 21 days of applying the <strong>15 Minute Hell </strong>program. <strong>I did it&#8230;and so can you.</strong></p>
<p>And I also promise you this: If you&#8217;ll only invest those 15 minutes each day following the principles of this incredible training system &#8211;there will be no stopping you.</p>

<p>LEARN MY STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS</p>
<p>When I began building my first online business I had absolutely no idea how to begin. I didn&#8217;t know anything about online branding, creating digital products, or how to sell to customers via the Internet. But, I did know a lot about fitness and I believed that I could turn this into a career as an online entrepreneur.</p>
<p>This course outlines everything I did (and still do today) to earn a living online. You will also benefit from learning about my mistakes: I wasted a LOT of time and energy on ideas and tactics that simply did not work. Avoid my early mistakes and save your time by following this step-by-step formula that has been proven to work.</p>
<p>HOW THE PROCESS WILL WORK FOR YOU</p>
<p>This course is broken into 4 main sections, each outlining an important step in the process of building your first online business. First, you will <strong>prepare</strong> to launch your business by finding a niche and identifying who your perfect customers will be.</p>
<p>Next, you will <strong>Build Your Presence</strong> online. I will teach you how to create a place where you can build a community, one that will let you display your knowledge and expertise. This is where you are going to begin enhancing your personal brand.</p>
<p>In the third step, you will <strong>Grow Your Audience</strong>. Learn how to attract a huge following of prospective customers. These followers will look to your for leadership and will rely on your expertise to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Finally, you will <strong>Monetize Your Business</strong>. Having an audience and a powerful personal brand are only useful if they help you earn money. The final section of the course explains how to create and sell the digital products and services your audience is looking for.</p>
<p>UPON COMPLETION OF THIS COURSE YOU WILL HAVE&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>Established your first online business</li>
<li>Created a group of followers who know and trust you</li>
<li>Developed your first products to sell online</li>
<li>Begun earning revenue by converting your followers into paying customers</li>
</ol>
<p>From there the sky is the limit. Once you&#8217;ve completed the process outlined in this course you will be able to &#8220;rinse and repeat&#8221; to create new products and generate larger revenues online.</p>
