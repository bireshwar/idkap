<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p>This course has the ambition to build a bridge between a century of science and 21st-century managers. A bridge between how our brain works and how to use that knowledge to improve our communication and leadership abilities.</p>
<p>To understand how and why Leadership works, we first need to understand what triggers us. We’ll be diving deep into our subconscious motivational processes. We’ll have a look at our brain, call it our ‘hardware’ and the subconscious programs running in it, that’s basically our software.</p>
<p>So expect tools, concrete, and simple tools that you will be able to use right away with your team and colleagues. In the end, the aim of this course is to open the way for a new understanding of motivation and communication, towards a new, highly effective and sustainable model for leadership in this 21st century.</p>
<p>But most of all, by the end of this course, my aim is that you, as a manager, as a leader, will have understood what a crucial role you play in your team and in its success. And that you will be able to leverage that knowledge and guide your team to a new level of collaboration and engagement.</p>

<p>I will provide a framework based on the latest insights in cognitive psychology and related fields. Within this framework, I will present your studies, research, and experiments on human behavior and I will show you how they apply to leadership and team management. </p>
<div class="audience__title">Who this course is for:</div>
<ul class="audience__list">
<li>Managers in charge of a team</li>
<li>Managers looking for tools and insights to manage their team</li>
<li>Professionals who want to improve their people skills</li>
<li>Professionals who want to learn more about human behavior</li>
