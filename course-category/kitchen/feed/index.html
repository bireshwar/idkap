<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p><em>How to eat like a caveman: the naturally GF Paleo diet eliminates all grains.</em></p>
<p><strong>One of the first things you have to recognize when you follow the Paleo diet is that there are many versions, and you have to make some decisions for yourself as you go along. But there’s universal agreement that vegetables, fruits and lean meats are indeed Paleo</strong></p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Paleo Diet Food List" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfQp2P4_qUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>I was diagnosed with celiac disease in 1998, the dark ages of gluten free. Those who knew of celiac disease were few and far between, and gluten-free products were a rare find on grocery store shelves. When I tried to order gluten-free food in a restaurant, people thought I was part of a cult or some strange religion.</p>
<p>Now things are different. Gluten-free products are readily available almost everywhere we turn, though many of them are processed foods.</p>
<p>When I started my gluten-free diet, I avoided processed foods and ate quite a bit of whole grains. However, even a healthy gluten-free diet did little to assuage my celiac disease symptoms. I was in constant digestive distress and felt far from healthy. Then I tried something new, taking my diet a step further: I went on a 100 percent grain-free Paleo diet. After three years of following the gluten-free diet and seeing little to no results, my gut started to heal quickly on the grain-free diet. I’ve been strictly grain-free ever since.</p>

<p><em>I will guide you through a menu that is designed for you, and together we will transform recipe instructions from the page to a delicious real life extravaganza!</em></p>
<p><strong>By learning to cook – rather than reading recipes – you’ll become a natural at substituting one ingredient or piece of equipment for another. I come to you and teach you to make the most of your kitchen, no matter what size it is or how much equipment you have, unlike cooking classes held in fancy schmancy professional kitchens.</strong></p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="How To Master 5 Basic Cooking Skills - Gordon Ramsay" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJy1ajvMU1k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>When you sign up for a Kitchen Coaching session, you will select a classic menu from the suggested options. That is, unless you are working towards a specific goal or health issue, in which case modifications are in order.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide to make, whether it’s sushi or pasta, the food will be a starting point from which you can jump into the wonderful world of intuitive cooking.</p>
<p>I will arrive at your house with all the necessary groceries and recipes, and together we’ll set off on a kitchen adventure. By the time I leave your (cleaned-up) kitchen, you’ll be excited about cooking!</p>

<p><em>Learn The Truth About Dieting For Weight Loss, Healthy Eating, Meal Planning, Fat Loss, Weight Loss Motivation</em></p>
<p><strong>This course is great for anyone and will help with weight loss over 50, fat loss for men and fat loss for women. It will teach you proper meal planning that is ideal for your fat loss diet and fat loss plans to achieve weight loss mastery.</strong></p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Daily Diet Plan for Weight Loss - Part 1 | Healthy Diet Schedule for A Day" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfjxmTMrOtk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>A healthy weight is an important element of good health. How much you eat—and what you eat—play central roles in maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight. Exercise is the other key actor.</p>
<p>For years, low-fat diets were thought to be the best way to lose weight. A growing body of evidence shows that low-fat diets often don&#8217;t work, in part because these diets often replace fat with easily digested carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Hundreds of diets have been created, many promising fast and permanent weight loss. Remember the cabbage soup diet? The grapefruit diet? How about the Hollywood 48 Hour Miracle diet, the caveman diet, the Subway diet, the apple cider vinegar diet, and a host of forgettable celebrity diets.</p>
<p>The best diet for losing weight is one that is good for all parts of your body, from your brain to your toes, and not just for your waistline. It is also one you can live with for a long time. In other words, a diet that offers plenty of good tasting and healthy choices, banishes few foods, and doesn&#8217;t require an extensive and expensive list of groceries or supplements.</p>
