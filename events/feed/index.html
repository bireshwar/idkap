										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For 10 days, 15 passionate writers, artists and filmmakers will be submerged in the density of the Peruvian Amazonas and the lives of the local Shawi. Guided by a diverse Team of acclaimed international creatives and Peruvian indigenous leaders, participants will be exposed to the raw nature of the rainforest, conflicting forces impacting indigenous communities and sustainable activities to address climate change.</p>



<p>Each participant will develop a short provocation/artwork under the guidance and supervision of the Team. Unlike other workshops, the local inhabitants will not be mere characters in these stories but will serve as mentors, project collaborators and cultural mediators. The process of creation will require some form of partnership between local and international storytellers in defining, style, method, message and culture.</p>



<p>The workshop will take place in various settings including the urban river-based culture of Iquitos, the tropical rainforest surroundings of the Allpahuayo Mishana Reserve, and the facilities of Formabiap’s indigenous bi-lingual education centre at Zúngarococha.</p>

<p>Learn about and discuss the real barriers to transformation leading to better and more sustainable schools:</p>



<p>*Get the Digital Learning Experience Standards.</p>



<p>*What is Personalized Workflow Learning.</p>



<p>*VR, AR, CTE Lab Trends- App Selection &amp; App Retirement.</p>



<p>SCHOOL AND DISTRICT LEADERS have been persuaded that the digital transformation is only about the design of HOW teachers use technology. However, real transformation goes much deeper. And, the implications are much broader to the institution. Confidence in public schools nationally is waning causing enrollment attrition nationwide. This is fueling the choice movement, which continues to grow as certain evidence of confidence erosion.</p>



<p>WORKSHOP LEADER&nbsp;<strong>LeiLani Cauthen</strong>, CEO of the Learning Counsel and Author of&nbsp;<strong><em>&#8220;The Consumerization of Learning&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>*<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>&nbsp;to the Digital Learning Experience Standards</p>



<p>*<strong>WHAT IS PERSONALIZED WORKFLOW LEARNING</strong>&nbsp;and why does managing student experience matter?</p>



<p>*<strong>WHAT IS “INFINITY LOGIC”</strong>&nbsp;and what does it have to do with how students today think and learn?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Researchers have shown that it has a positive impact on weight loss, type-2-diabetes, cardiovascular disease and: AGEING]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For many of us January is the month of FASTING &#8211; reducing calories or eating no sweets. A popular form of fasting is INTERMITTENT FASTING &#8211; the IF diet, the 16:8 diet or the 5:2 diet. It is based on alternating intervals of eating and fasting.</p>



<p>WHY IS IT SO POPULAR? Researchers have shown that it has a positive impact on weight loss, type-2-diabetes, cardiovascular disease and: AGEING: When we fast, exciting things happen in our bodies on the cellular and molecular level: For example our body’s cells change the expression of certain genes and initiate important cellular repair processes.</p>



<p>We have invited a nutrition scientist and a startup to take us through the scientific evidence of fasting as well as new solutions available on the market.
