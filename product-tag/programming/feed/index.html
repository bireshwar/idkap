										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book is not just about learning to program; although you will learn to code. If you want to program professionally, it is not enough to learn to code; that is why, in addition to helping you learn to program, I also cover the rest of the things you need to know to program professionally that classes and books don&#8217;t teach you. &#8220;The Self-taught Programmer&#8221; is a roadmap, a guide to take you from writing your first Python program, to passing your first technical interview.</p>
<p>I am a self-taught programmer. After a year of self-study, I learned to program well enough to land a job as a software engineer II at eBay. Once I got there, I realized I was severely under-prepared. I was overwhelmed by the amount of things I needed to know but hadn&#8217;t learned yet. My journey learning to program, and my experience at my first job as a software engineer were the inspiration for this book.</p>
