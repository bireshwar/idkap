										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Did you know that Pinterest has 200+ Million monthly users? And a huge portion of those users are not only clicking through on pins to get more information, but they&#8217;re also BUYING things they find there!&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I noticed that over 60% of my own traffic was coming from Pinterest (where I have around 6600 followers) and only 3% was coming from Instagram (where I have 110k+ followers) &#8212;<em>&nbsp;despite</em>&nbsp;the fact that I was spending way less time on Pinterest and way too much time on Instagram I knew I needed to change my game plan.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> This class is especially for artists, makers, and creatives! But it will be helpful to anyone who wants to learn more about the power of free exposure you can get on Pinterest. </p></blockquote>

<p>And in the end we will share our class project: a Pin based on all of the information we learned in the class! (Plus I share a link to a free trial of my favorite Pinterest approved software!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I hope you&#8217;ll join me in the class! And if you have any questions, please feel free to post them in the class discussion area.</p>

<p> When discussing gamification and game-based learning there is often some confusion as to how they differ. Many people use the terms interchangeably but they are not the same. However they are often linked together so it isn’t always easy to separate them. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Game-based learning and gamification have been around for a number of years at the elementary and high school level. More recently it has been making its way into higher education as it offers a number of benefits to students.</p></blockquote>



<h2>What is Game-Based Learning?</h2>



<p>Game-Based Learning or GBL is using a game as part of the learning process. Some examples of GBL could be using monopoly to teach the basics of money management or playing scrabble to help improve vocabulary skills. However, today when people talk about game-based learning they are usually referring to digital game-based learning. Game-based learning teaches through repetition, failure and the accomplishment of goals which is basically the way players become good at video games.</p>



<h2>What is Gamification?</h2>



<p>In education<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification_of_learning">&nbsp;gamification</a>&nbsp;is the introduction of game-like elements into the learning environment to help motivate students and make the process more engaging. This is accomplished by taking some of the elements that make games fun and that motivate people to keep playing and using those elements in a learning situation. Some examples of gamification include:</p>



<ul><li>Points/Badges : The use of points and badges provides tangible evidence of accomplishment</li><li>Immediate Feedback: Fast response to actions that are taken rather than waiting for a paper to be graded.</li><li>Levels/Quests: Provide missions and goals to be accomplished</li><li>Leveling Up: Indication of achievement and opening up of new missions, badges and activities</li><li>Collaboration/Teamwork: Accomplish a goal working with others</li></ul>

<p>Teaching in a fully online environment can be daunting even for seasoned online instructors when they have to prep a new course.&nbsp; However, with a few simple strategies, the process can be smooth and enjoyable.&nbsp;Here are four strategies that any instructor can use to successfully build an online course.&nbsp; </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Steps for success include&nbsp;involving&nbsp;the learner, making&nbsp;collaboration work, devising a consistent structure&nbsp;and revising based on evaluation.&nbsp;</p><cite>By  Amy Rottmann&nbsp;and&nbsp;Salena Rabidoux </cite></blockquote>



<p>A common perception is that online courses require students to just read or view videos, and then regurgitate the information in an essay or simple discussion post. &nbsp;However, this is false because there are numerous activities that fully engage online students.</p>



<p>Students should demonstrate their understanding of the content as well as heighten their engagement with the content throughout any course.&nbsp; Instructors can incorporate authentic activities that connect real-world relevance and content knowledge. Authentic activities can range from examining case studies to creating problem-based scenarios in which the students research the problem and create solutions or address gaps within the problem.</p>



<p> Instructors also can use inquiry-based learning (IBL), which requires students to investigate questions they have concerning the content.&nbsp; One strategy that online instructors can implement to establish IBL is through the implementation of Know, Want to Know, and Learned (KWL) charts. Utilizing KWL charts can initiate exploration of the content as students identify what they know and what they want to know about the topic. </p>

<p>High quality education can make all the difference in people’s lives. It helps individuals escape poverty, earn a promotion, or find better paid jobs. But getting a university degree or a training certificate often costs a lot of money, and strict class schedules clash with work shifts, preventing people from enrolling in educational programs. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Fortunately, online courses are providing a viable alternative for millions of people. And as a part of the thriving e-learning industry that will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/07/31/e-learning-climbing-to-325-billion-by-2025-uf-canvas-absorb-schoology-moodle/#60583d483b39">grow</a>&nbsp;to $325 billion by 2025, they’re no longer a fringe idea.  </p></blockquote>



<p>Instead, online courses are becoming increasingly popular, and there are many reasons why they’re&nbsp;<a href="https://richardvanhooijdonk.com/en/keynote/the-future-of-education/">the future of education</a>.&nbsp; </p>



<ol><li>Online learning offers convenience and flexibility</li><li>High-quality student-tutor interactions</li><li>Studying online is affordable for many people</li><li>All age groups benefit from online learning</li><li>More students can be enrolled</li><li>There’s a vast amount of online learning resources</li><li>Web-based learning will grow in popularity</li></ol>



<p><strong>Online learning offers convenience and flexibility</strong></p>



<p>Flexibility is one of the key reasons behind the growing demand for web-based learning. According to survey results published&nbsp;by the university ranking website Best Colleges, 59% of students who enroll in online education programs have children and 50% of them are employed. They highly value the opportunity to study when they can, as lectures are typically archived for later reference, making compulsory campus attendance a thing of the past. Also, they can work faster or slower on course material, depending on their current needs and understanding of the subject matter.</p>



<p><strong>High-quality student-tutor interactions</strong></p>



<p>Another advantage of&nbsp;<a href="https://thetrendsnext.com/technology-is-redefining-education-heres-how/">online education</a>&nbsp;is improved communication between students and tutors. A study by California State University in San Bernardino<a href="https://www.nitrocollege.com/blog/online-college/why-online-education-better">found</a>&nbsp;that although people who study online absorb knowledge equally well as those who go to class, they’re more active in discussions and enjoy a better interaction with instructors. Technologies such as video conferencing and VOIP calls make it easy to communicate with people across the world. Online students also benefit from more frequent assessments, with professors able to spot knowledge gaps faster and provide suggestions on how to move forward.</p>
