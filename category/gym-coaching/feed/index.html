					<description><![CDATA[On the upside, there are still plenty of ways that you and your clients can practice self-care during these troubling times, even if you’re under orders to stay at home as much as possible.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We could all use a little self-care right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many people’s usual coping strategies are simply unavailable&nbsp;at the moment, whether that’s socializing with friends or family, playing or watching sports,&nbsp;going to the gym&nbsp;or enjoying a little retail therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the upside, there are still plenty of ways that you and your clients can practice self-care during these troubling times, even if you’re under orders to stay at home as much as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Practice&nbsp;</strong><strong>Mindfulness</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mindfulness practices have been shown to offer a host of physical, psychological and social benefits that can lead to decreases in perceived stress, improved self-efficacy, enhanced emotional regulation and a greater sense of meaning and purpose in life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relaxation counters the short-term effects of stress by decreasing blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate and muscle tension. Over the long-term, relaxation can mitigate certain health issues, including hypertension, anxiety and even cancer (Esch,&nbsp;Fricchione&nbsp;&amp; Stefano, 2003; Keefer &amp; Blanchard, 2002),&nbsp;in addition to&nbsp;improving&nbsp;overall health and healing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some mindful practices that you and your clients might want to try:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><em>Mindful movement, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, walking or cycling:</em>&nbsp;Your clients might be surprised to learn that one of the two common aspects of practices that elicit relaxation is repetition (Benson &amp;&nbsp;Klipper, 1975), as is experienced during&nbsp;exercises like&nbsp;walking and cycling.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Meditation:</em>&nbsp;This can include any of&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;types of meditation, which you should encourage your clients to research. While some people thrive with an ongoing transcendental meditation practice, others may simply want&nbsp;a way to get&nbsp;10 or 15 minutes of quiet&nbsp;time or prayer&nbsp;during a stressful period. This is where the second aspect of practices that elicit relaxation comes in—a passive disregard of thoughts as they arise (Benson &amp;&nbsp;Klipper, 1975).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><em>Breathing exercises:</em>&nbsp;Again, there are&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;breathing exercises that clients can explore, including diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Sleep</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sleep disorders&nbsp;are common in modern society, with&nbsp;one in three U.S. adults reporting that they usually get less than the recommended amount of sleep&nbsp;(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). This is only made worse by feelings of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/professional/expert-articles/7522/the-benefits-of-making-healthy-choices-during-social-isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depression or anxiety</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Healthy sleep patterns should be part of every behavior-change program and are particularly important&nbsp;during these troubling times, when everyone is under heightened levels of stress. Inadequate sleep has been linked to a variety of health risks, including heart disease, weight gain, depression and&nbsp;reduced cognitive function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Share the following tips with your clients to help them get a good night’s sleep (American Sleep Foundation, 2018):&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Create a relaxing sleep environment&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Follow a consistent sleep schedule&nbsp;</li><li>Follow a soothing bedtime routine&nbsp;</li><li>Limit exposure to bright light, especially blue light&nbsp;</li><li>Try to be exposed to natural light early in the day&nbsp;</li><li>Exercise daily&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Avoid caffeine and alcohol&nbsp;</li><li>Avoid eating a large meal to close to bedtime&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Social Connectedness</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>So many of us are feeling isolated, lonely, anxious or depressed right now. As a health coach or exercise professional, one of the best things you can do is provide a positive experience each time you interact with a client. Also, remind them that none of us are in this alone, and that the importance of social connectedness cannot be overstated. Encourage them to use Facetime,&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;or&nbsp;another video conferencing tools&nbsp;to interact with friends and family members or to reach out to people they may have lost touch with over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>People all over the world are having virtual dance parties, taking classes online, attending virtual happy hours and finding other&nbsp;creative&nbsp;ways&nbsp;to have fun&nbsp;and&nbsp;take a break from the craziness we’re all living through. We may all be isolated in our homes&nbsp;at the moment, but we need each other more than ever. That’s great advice to share with clients—and to be mindful of yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
