<p>Did you know that Pinterest has 200+ Million monthly users? And a huge portion of those users are not only clicking through on pins to get more information, but they&#8217;re also BUYING things they find there!&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I noticed that over 60% of my own traffic was coming from Pinterest (where I have around 6600 followers) and only 3% was coming from Instagram (where I have 110k+ followers) &#8212;<em>&nbsp;despite</em>&nbsp;the fact that I was spending way less time on Pinterest and way too much time on Instagram I knew I needed to change my game plan.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> This class is especially for artists, makers, and creatives! But it will be helpful to anyone who wants to learn more about the power of free exposure you can get on Pinterest. </p></blockquote>



<p>Maybe you do, too?</p>



<p>In this class I&#8217;ll be covering:</p>



<ul><li>Perfecting Your Pinterest Profile</li><li>Creating Eye-Catching Pinterest Boards</li><li>The Anatomy of a Perfect Pin</li><li>Pinning from Etsy</li><li>Pinning from Your Website or Blog</li><li>How to Pin? Yep! How to Pin!</li><li>Making Your Life Easier by Scheduling Pins</li></ul>



<p>And in the end we will share our class project: a Pin based on all of the information we learned in the class! (Plus I share a link to a free trial of my favorite Pinterest approved software!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>I hope you&#8217;ll join me in the class! And if you have any questions, please feel free to post them in the class discussion area.</p>
