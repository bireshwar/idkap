										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many student teachers the prospect of facing their first classroom experience is overwhelming. This book presents a realistic view of what they will face in the classroom, but also provides them the skills they need to become reflective, professional teachers in their own right. </p>
<p>Early Childhood Learning Experience: Learning to Teach Well is a combination of an informational text and workbook-like exercises that encourage self-reflection and ways for each student to get the most out of their fieldwork experience. It includes features from real student teachers as well as from current mentor teachers. Developmentally and culturally appropriate practices are woven throughout the text to ensure readers are aware of national standards for programs and practices.</p>
