					<description><![CDATA[ The advice you’re about to watch is based both on scientific research and my personal experience. I will share fundamental knowledge that will help you build more confidence in your abilities and reach your goals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p>Most of us have no problems identifying goals we want to accomplish. It’s putting these plans into action that is difficult.</p>
<p>Sometimes we lack discipline or motivation. However, there’s another reason why you might struggle to make changes in your life – <strong>you have low self-efficacy and don’t believe in your abilities</strong>.</p>
<p>What is self-efficacy? What are the main four sources of it? How can you become more confident in your skills?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions I’ll answer in this short course. The advice you’re about to watch is based both on scientific research and my personal experience. I will share fundamental knowledge that will <strong>help you build more confidence in your abilities and reach your goals</strong>.</p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="How To Unlock YOUR Confidence | The Alpha M Confidence Course" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTHXpr1s_34?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>



<p>Here are just a few things you will learn from the course:</p>
<p>&#8211; Five characteristics of people with strong self-efficacy and five characteristics of people with weak self-efficacy. <strong>These behaviors determine whether you’ll realize your full potential or succumb to mediocrity.</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; What you can learn from building a university in space (and what it has to do with the belief in your own abilities). <strong>It’s the single most important thing to achieve bigger and bigger goals.</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; A simple therapy to teach you how to handle failure the right way. It’s uncomfortable, but you can be sure <strong>it will kill your fear of failure once and for all</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8211; What a strange study about hitting dolls or treating them kindly can teach you about how others affect your beliefs about your competence. <strong>It’s the second most effective way to increase the strength of your belief in your abilities.</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; What a phenomenon discovered by a German industrial psychologist can teach you about motivation. <strong>There’s a simple way to inspire you to put more effort into your goals.</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>The #1 key to improving the confidence in your abilities</strong>. If you don’t have time to watch the entire course, learn this one tip alone.</p>
<p>&#8211; What a study on experts and novices can teach you about how experts approach problems. You too can adapt this behavior to <strong>shorten your learning curve and develop a stronger belief in your abilities</strong>.</p>

<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p>Do you want to have more business success? Mastering body language is the missing ingredient for many business owners. Nonverbal communication can not only help you be more effective in your business dealings, but it can also give you an added edge above competitors.</p>
<p><em>93% of our communication is nonverbal.</em></p>
<p>But we rarely think about our body language when dealing with clients, investors, or networking. We think about what we are going to say, but we don&#8217;t consider how we say something. Research shows how we say something is even more important than what we say.</p>

<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p>This course has the ambition to build a bridge between a century of science and 21st-century managers. A bridge between how our brain works and how to use that knowledge to improve our communication and leadership abilities.</p>
<p>To understand how and why Leadership works, we first need to understand what triggers us. We’ll be diving deep into our subconscious motivational processes. We’ll have a look at our brain, call it our ‘hardware’ and the subconscious programs running in it, that’s basically our software.</p>
<p>So expect tools, concrete, and simple tools that you will be able to use right away with your team and colleagues. In the end, the aim of this course is to open the way for a new understanding of motivation and communication, towards a new, highly effective and sustainable model for leadership in this 21st century.</p>
<p>But most of all, by the end of this course, my aim is that you, as a manager, as a leader, will have understood what a crucial role you play in your team and in its success. And that you will be able to leverage that knowledge and guide your team to a new level of collaboration and engagement.</p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Neuroscience and Leadership" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cq4nUqEHiIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>I will provide a framework based on the latest insights in cognitive psychology and related fields. Within this framework, I will present your studies, research, and experiments on human behavior and I will show you how they apply to leadership and team management. </p>
<div class="audience__title">Who this course is for:</div>
<ul class="audience__list">
<li>Managers in charge of a team</li>
<li>Managers looking for tools and insights to manage their team</li>
<li>Professionals who want to improve their people skills</li>
<li>Professionals who want to learn more about human behavior</li>
</ul>
