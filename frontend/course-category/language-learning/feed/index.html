<p>The purpose of this course is to provide the advanced writing techniques commonly used for inspiring readers and get your work published. Enroll soon to get the best offer for course fee discount.</p>



<p>We built practical lessons with helpful activities to help you hone your skills and make the best out of writing practice within 15 weeks of learning.</p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Being a Professional Writer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyKTZs5Unpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also provide you with materials and reference documents. Throughout the course, you may want to come back and look at these materials. This section should not take you an entire week.</span></p>



<p>In this 15-week course, my goal is to give you an honest look at how to become a writer—using lessons we&#8217;ve built for over 10+ years working with some of the top publishers &amp; specialists in the publishing world. Getting your work published is not impossible nowadays, but getting yourself known as a real author is really hard. You need to build your own style and voice.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll walk you through each of the essential steps in this course.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this 5 week course, you will learn how to identify and make a strong personal introduction. You will develop and demonstrate the speaking skills for group discussions: how to agree or disagree, how to clarify, restate and summarize. </span></p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="IELTS Speaking | Super Methods with Jay!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXPSgMo0C1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will review and practice how to give information and respond to requests on the phone. You will study and role-play effective interviewing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will prepare and give a sales “pitch”, introducing a product or service. Throughout the course, you will adjust how you speak English and you will become more fluent and accurate when you speak. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will demonstrate culturally appropriate body language and tone. As you work through the course, you will complete self- and peer-evaluations. Through a combination of lectures, comprehension and vocabulary quizzes, practice and performance, you’ll gain the skills and confidence to communicate well in English, anywhere in the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of this course, we hope that our students would become confident speakers. </span></p>
