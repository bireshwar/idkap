<p>Being healthy and living a happy and fulfilled life, respecting all life forms and living in harmony is the <strong>ultimate goal for billions of people worldwide,</strong> making it the <strong><em>perfect time</em></strong> to earn a vegan nutrition health coach certification by enrolling and becoming a <strong>Certified Vegan Nutrition Health Coach.</strong></p>

<p>In the absence of definitive pharmacological solutions for the treatment of cognitive deterioration and dementia, a multidisciplinary approach is currently proposed as a preventive measure aiming to promote active and healthy aging. </p>
<p>Likewise, evaluation, monitoring, and treatment of cognitive, emotional or social interaction problems in neurological pathologies associated with aging require the involvement of different disciplines, from neuropsychology to robotics, through nutrition, music, physiotherapy or information technologies, among others.</p>
