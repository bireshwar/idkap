<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p>In this course, I’ll teach you how to practically apply color theory concepts to your digital art, so you can stop being afraid of color and start using it to elevate your art to a whole new level!</p>
<p>Color can be a scary aspect of any visual art, since poor use of color can easily make or break a great drawing, painting, logo, or sketch. Early in my own studies, I was repeatedly disappointed by the color theory tutorials I found online. Sure, I would learn some terminology&#8211;warm, cool, primary, secondary, complementary, etc&#8211;but this is just terminology! How do I actually use these concepts in my art?!</p>
<p>If you’ve ever found yourself asking that question, this is the course for you!</p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Color Theory for Noobs | Beginner Guide" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AvgCkHrcj90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>



<p>In addition to the hours of real-time, step-by-step video lessons, you’ll also get:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Line drawings for practice, so you can focus on color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Layered PSD files used in the lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples from my pro work as a digital colorist at Image Comics &amp; Top Cow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Photoshop is used throughout this course, the color theory concepts taught here can be applied with most of your favorite digital art applications such as Photoshop, Clip Studio, Paintstorm, Procreate, Corel Painter, Sketchbook Pro, Krita, ArtRage, etc.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This course gives you the knowledge required to create accurate portraits by exploring the "ins and outs" of each feature, the underlying structure of the face, how light effects the form of the face, strategies for locating facial proportions, and techniques used by artists and illustrators to ensure accuracy every time.]]></description>

<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p>&#8220;Portrait Drawing The Smart Way&#8221; is a complete video course on drawing portraits designed for beginner and intermediate artists. The goal of this course is to provide the learner with a rich learning experience through &#8220;easy to digest&#8221; modules consisting of video demonstrations and accompanying ebooks. Designed for beginner and intermediate artists, this course lays the foundation required for success with portrait drawing.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it. Portrait drawing can be intimidating to some. You sit down to draw a representational drawing of a person and something goes horribly wrong along the way. You&#8217;re not sure what happened, but you know that the drawing you just created just doesn&#8217;t quite look like the person. Fortunately, this doesn&#8217;t have to be case. With a bit of knowledge, practice, and few &#8220;secrets&#8221; used by the pros, accurate and realistic portrait drawings can be created by anyone &#8211; including you!</p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Learn portrait drawing in easy steps - part 1: always starts from composition" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/36_AwMmPWxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>This course has been designed to accelerate learning by teaching to many different learning styles. Not all of us prefer to learn from watching videos. Some of us prefer to learn from books as well as videos. Each course module includes an illustrated ebook that corresponds with the video. Every step and concept is clearly illustrated and described in each downloadable ebook. The ebooks are a fantastic compliment to the comprehensive videos.</p>
<div class="audience" data-purpose="course-audience">
<div class="audience__title">Who this course is for:</div>
<ul class="audience__list">
<li>Anyone who wants to learn how to draw accurate portraits.</li>
<li>Beginner and Intermediate art students will love the simplicity and clarity in which the lessons are presented.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p>Watercolor painting at its core is built upon pigment, water, and a painting surface, and in order to master the medium you need to thoroughly understand your materials. This course is designed to give you an in-depth look at the properties of each material used in the watercolor painting process. With this understanding, beginners will have an easier time learning techniques and experienced painters will be better equipped to perfect their skill and solve potential problems. This isn’t a hands-on painting class, but rather is a lecture-based course containing information you aren&#8217;t likely to find anywhere else.</p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Watercolor Lessons for Beginners" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NkhQsTpkWrs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>



<div class="audience__title">Who this course is for:</div>
<ul class="audience__list">
<li>This course applies to both new painters as well as experienced painters. For the new painter, it will make the learning process much easier. For the experienced painter, it will give you a deeper understanding of the medium.</li>
<li>This is not a watercolor technique class. Instead, this is intended to give viewers broader, deeper understanding of the medium.</li>
