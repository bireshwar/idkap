					<description><![CDATA[Online courses are often attractive to students because they offer flexibility, particularly for those with demanding professional or personal responsibilities.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Online learning environment can seem intimidating to students who haven’t tried it. But, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://advanced.jhu.edu/about-us/faculty/jennifer-bachner-phd/">Dr. Jennifer Bachner</a>, Director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://advanced.jhu.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/government-analytics/">MS in Government Analytics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://advanced.jhu.edu/academics/certificate-programs/government-analytics/">Certificate in Government Analytics</a>, online learning isn’t much different than a classroom.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>By employing a few essential strategies, any student can learn not only to succeed, but to flourish in the online learning environment. </p></blockquote>



<h2>Top five strategies for success in online learning:</h2>



<h4>1. Devote consistent blocs of time to the class</h4>



<p>Online courses are often attractive to students because they offer flexibility, particularly for those with demanding professional or personal responsibilities. This flexibility, however, can lead students into trouble. It can be tempting for students to delay working through the course material, thinking they’ll find time later in the week. </p>



<h4>2. Communicate regularly with the professor</h4>



<p>Opening and using these lines of communication will benefit you both during and beyond the course. During the course, it’s important to ask questions when the material or assignments are unclear and discuss larger assignments such as research papers. Use the mode of communication preferred by the instructor (e.g. email, Skype, phone) but don’t shrink away from these conversations. </p>



<h4>3. Engage with your classmates</h4>



<p>Don’t limit your discussion postings to responding to the prompts posted by the instructor. Add your own insights and questions to the discussion. I always appreciate when students post a relevant news article or scholarly publication they’ve come across. These contributions help other students relate the course material to the real world and other areas of study. </p>



<h4>4. Begin your work early</h4>



<p>In an online class, particularly for first-time students, there may be technical difficulties to overcome. Take the risk of these difficulties into account, and give yourself time to acclimate to new software and hardware. Further, give your instructors a reasonable amount of time to answer your questions. In an online class, exchanging emails or arranging phone conversations takes time. In short, expect that you will encounter hurdles when completing the work and leave yourself time to overcome them.</p>



<h4>5. Remember that online classes vary greatly</h4>



<p>Just as with on-the-ground classes, there are many ways to design an online class. Research course offerings ahead of time to determine if the instructor, structure and material are a good fit for you. Some online classes, for example, rely largely on the discussion boards to further your learning while others make heavier use of group projects, individually-written papers or collaborative problem sets.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Without your physical presence in the classroom, it’s vital that you establish a virtual presence at the very beginning of the eLearning course. Online teachers need to be engaging and supporting students right from the start and for the duration of the course, to maintain an effective learning community.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Online courses have become an incredibly popular way for students and employees to advance their education or professional development. Teaching an online course requires different methods from the traditional classroom, so it’s important that teachers adapt or develop their skills to the online learning environment, to make their materials effective and engaging for learners.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Let’s look at 5 strategies you can implement to improve your online teaching and make your eLearning course a successful experience for both you and your learners. </p></blockquote>



<h3><strong>1. Engage With Your Learners Online</strong></h3>



<p>Without your physical presence in the classroom, it’s vital that you establish a virtual presence at the very beginning of the eLearning course. Online teachers need to be engaging and supporting students right from the start and for the duration of the course, to maintain an effective learning community.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Create A Supportive Learning Environment</strong></h3>



<p>As an online teacher, you have an opportunity to create a supportive online community for your learners.</p>



<p>The best way to achieve this is through encouraging both teacher-to-student engagement and student-to-student interaction.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Use A Mix Of Learning Tools For Better Engagement</strong></h3>



<p>These days, we’re fortunate to have the technology to create virtual learning environments that allow us to collaborate and engage just as well as if we were in the classroom.</p>



<p>As Dr Boettche says, “the variety of activities that are now possible online makes it possible to create many types of effective learning environments.”</p>



<h3><strong>4. Provide Ongoing Feedback</strong></h3>



<p>Feedback is an essential component of all effective learning environments – including online.</p>



<p>As an online teacher, your feedback will help to create an eLearning experience that is informative, engaging, and motivational for the learner.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>5. Make eLearning Content Mobile</strong></h3>



<p>It’s wise to acknowledge the importance of mobile learning for online teachers, with students and employees now accustomed to using their mobile devices for learning.</p>



<p>Mobile learning holds key advantages for learners, allowing them to access up-to-date course materials and relevant content anywhere, anytime. With bite-sized pieces of information available to be digested quickly and easily, learners can work through course materials at their own pace, assisting both performance and productivity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, organizations and academic institutes require robust and strategic&nbsp;<strong>learning</strong>&nbsp;<strong>management</strong>&nbsp;<strong>systems</strong>&nbsp;(LMS) that can automate manual processes of traditional tools. Effective learning management systems can empower departments and enable business growth, as well as further educational initiatives. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Unlike the human researchers, the computer program was able to identify about twice as many systems. However, after additional investigation, the human researchers successfully confirmed about 97% of the info provided by Kimmon’s program. </p></blockquote>



<p>Over the years, LMS has become a vital tool to achieve enterprise learning objectives. It is no wonder the LMS market will be worth $<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-01-07/lms-market-worth-22-4-billion-by-2023-exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets">22.4 billion by 2023</a>. Learning management systems, for instance, can be used in several formats. You can use it as a formal, experimental, or social managerial compliance training program.</p>



<p>Moreover, the role of eLearning to generate revenue for enterprises continues to evolve. LMS personalizes feedback to promote a self-regulating learning process. In fact, LMS has been proven to increase the effectiveness of students’ and employees’ learning outcomes.</p>



<p><strong>The Evolving Role of the Learning Management System</strong></p>



<p>A revolutionary change in the LMS is the contextualization of the learning process for teachers and employers. The right LMS can enable increased interaction between instructors and learners. Consequently, a collaborative virtual learning experience improves outcomes for online learners.</p>



<p><strong>Adoption of LMS by K-12 Schools</strong></p>



<p>It is true – the skepticism towards LMS no longer exists. And why would it? The majority of institutions have successfully implemented the systems in higher education to improve student’s learning process. Similarly, LMS is now widely used by K-12 schools. It does, however, present an opportunity for researchers to learn the standardized testing process at such a scale.</p>



<p>What’s interesting is that the adoption of an LMS solution goes beyond higher standardized test scores. However, this effectiveness is interconnected with the cost and nature of the system itself. For example, an education system should have a proprietary system configuration, while an open-source solution is preferable for an organization.</p>

<p> When discussing gamification and game-based learning there is often some confusion as to how they differ. Many people use the terms interchangeably but they are not the same. However they are often linked together so it isn’t always easy to separate them. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Game-based learning and gamification have been around for a number of years at the elementary and high school level. More recently it has been making its way into higher education as it offers a number of benefits to students.</p></blockquote>



<h2>What is Game-Based Learning?</h2>



<p>Game-Based Learning or GBL is using a game as part of the learning process. Some examples of GBL could be using monopoly to teach the basics of money management or playing scrabble to help improve vocabulary skills. However, today when people talk about game-based learning they are usually referring to digital game-based learning. Game-based learning teaches through repetition, failure and the accomplishment of goals which is basically the way players become good at video games.</p>



<h2>What is Gamification?</h2>



<p>In education<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification_of_learning">&nbsp;gamification</a>&nbsp;is the introduction of game-like elements into the learning environment to help motivate students and make the process more engaging. This is accomplished by taking some of the elements that make games fun and that motivate people to keep playing and using those elements in a learning situation. Some examples of gamification include:</p>



<ul><li>Points/Badges : The use of points and badges provides tangible evidence of accomplishment</li><li>Immediate Feedback: Fast response to actions that are taken rather than waiting for a paper to be graded.</li><li>Levels/Quests: Provide missions and goals to be accomplished</li><li>Leveling Up: Indication of achievement and opening up of new missions, badges and activities</li><li>Collaboration/Teamwork: Accomplish a goal working with others</li></ul>

<p>Teaching in a fully online environment can be daunting even for seasoned online instructors when they have to prep a new course.&nbsp; However, with a few simple strategies, the process can be smooth and enjoyable.&nbsp;Here are four strategies that any instructor can use to successfully build an online course.&nbsp; </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Steps for success include&nbsp;involving&nbsp;the learner, making&nbsp;collaboration work, devising a consistent structure&nbsp;and revising based on evaluation.&nbsp;</p><cite>By  Amy Rottmann&nbsp;and&nbsp;Salena Rabidoux </cite></blockquote>



<p>A common perception is that online courses require students to just read or view videos, and then regurgitate the information in an essay or simple discussion post. &nbsp;However, this is false because there are numerous activities that fully engage online students.</p>



<p>Students should demonstrate their understanding of the content as well as heighten their engagement with the content throughout any course.&nbsp; Instructors can incorporate authentic activities that connect real-world relevance and content knowledge. Authentic activities can range from examining case studies to creating problem-based scenarios in which the students research the problem and create solutions or address gaps within the problem.</p>



<p> Instructors also can use inquiry-based learning (IBL), which requires students to investigate questions they have concerning the content.&nbsp; One strategy that online instructors can implement to establish IBL is through the implementation of Know, Want to Know, and Learned (KWL) charts. Utilizing KWL charts can initiate exploration of the content as students identify what they know and what they want to know about the topic. </p>
