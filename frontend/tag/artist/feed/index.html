<p>Artist&nbsp;<a href="https://adamsdoyle.com/fine-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam S. Doyle</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/?s=adam+s+doyle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously</a>) is known for his paintings of birds and other animals that call attention to, rather than mask, his brush strokes. In his latest series, “Night Fall Trees,” Doyle shifts his focus to a different living entity. “By putting trees front and center as subjects, instead of relegating them to the background where they usually are, I’m saying these silent sentinels of our planet deserve our full attention and respect,” the artist shares with Colossal.</p>



<p>Like his other series, “Night Fall Trees” centers on Doyle’s obsession with energy. The swirling tree branches are wound tightly within each other, the tufts of leaves envelop the top branches, and the widespread roots bury themselves into the ground. Inspired by a nighttime glimpse of a well-lit tree last October, Doyle also says this series is about the seasons and the resilience the trees have.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Fall is often associated with colorful foliage, which is best seen during the day. But fall is also a season about transition, heading in for the long nights and bone-chilling cold. Winter is a hard time. Trees get through it, though. These paintings reflect on being ready for what’s to come and like the trees knowing we’ll get through it. There will be blossoming once again in the spring.</p></blockquote>



<p>Doyle tells Colossal his creative plans include writing fiction and nonfiction. You can keep up with the artist’s latest energized paintings on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/adamsdoylestudio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>. He even has another&nbsp;<a href="https://jagdalack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">site</a>&nbsp;for his children’s projects.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoy that feeling of walking around a new place not knowing what I might discover around the corner. I often try to recreate the feeling of a place I have visited in my personal work.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Paging through a photo album detailing every moment of a friend’s poolside vacation might not be a riveting activity, but flipping through Angela Mckay’s sketchbooks filled with tiny paintings of her travels certainly is. The Brooklyn-based pattern designer and illustrator of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ohkiistudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ohkii Studio</a>&nbsp;documents the lush scenery, cavernous waters, and hilly villages she sees on the streets of Lagos, Calamosche Beach on Italy’s southern coast, and in Joshua Tree National Park. Mckay generally positions her miniature paintings against the real-life backdrop, juxtaposing the two depictions that she then shares on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ohkiistudio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>



<p>The artist tells Colossal that she frequently recreates some of the pieces in her sketchbooks on a larger scale after returning home, relying on her earlier representation for the tiny details she otherwise might not remember. “Often when I’m traveling, I have this urgent feeling that I need to capture everything I’m experiencing, the sights, feelings and textures of a place,” she says.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I really enjoy that feeling of walking around a new place not knowing what I might discover around the corner. I often try to recreate the feeling of a place I have visited in my personal work… I really enjoy the experience of looking at a painting and being transported back to that experience. It’s a nice way to escape from your day to day!</p></blockquote>



<p>The pocket-size notebooks are a crucial component of Mckay’s process, and she utilizes them in both her personal projects and her work for clients. “They just allow me to play with ideas and explore other directions without having to commit to anything,” she says. To pick up one of Mckay’s watercolor and gouache&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ohkiistudio.com/original-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artworks</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ohkiistudio.com/shop-prints" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prints</a>, head to her shop.

					<description><![CDATA[Many of the artists created their first self-portraits in years, if not ever, specifically for the show, which includes work from Aleah Chapin, Cesar Piette, and Christian Rex van Minnen, among others.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“<a href="https://www.sugarlift.com/blogs/events/me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ME: An Exhibition of Contemporary Self-Portraiture</a>” asks 22 contemporary artists to explore who they are and how they present themselves. Curated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sugarlift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sugarlift</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://juxtapoz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Juxtapoz</a>&nbsp;contributing editor and Colossal contributor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sashabogojev/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sasha Bogojev</a>, the exhibition presents each artists’ understanding of themselves and of the history of self-portraiture. Cesar Piette’s abstract blue face resembles dripping paint partially masked by glasses, while Prudence Flint portrays a woman napping on a pink bed next to a guitar. Many of the artists created their first self-portraits in years, if not ever, specifically for the show, which includes work from Aleah Chapin, Cesar Piette, and Christian Rex van Minnen, among others.</p>



<p>In a conversation with Colossal, Bogojov answered a few questions about contemporary culture and self-awareness, how they influence self-portraiture, and the ways current conceptions of identity show up in ME.</p>



<p><strong>Colossal:</strong>&nbsp;How have perceptions of the self changed since the creation of such a selfie-obsessed culture?</p>



<p><strong>Bogojev:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, that is a tough one and I’m certain there are papers if not books written on that subject. But I do feel that a selfie-obsessed culture created more self-awareness on different levels. For this show, in particular, I feel like lots of artists wanted to fight against the popular idea of “self” or what we know now as selfie, by presenting themselves imperfect, flawed, caricatured, even grotesque in some cases.</p>



<p><strong>Colossal:</strong>&nbsp;Could you talk a little more about the intersections between psyche, mirror, and others that you see in contemporary self-portraiture?</p>



<p><strong>Bogojev:</strong>&nbsp;Modern-day takes are rarely realistic renderings of one’s mirror image and are often including elements that suggest qualities beyond that. Whether playing with light, formatting, color scheme, or simply going away from realism completely, they often focus on the author’s character, emotions, and such. I like to believe that this show encompasses that really well with the variety of approaches and visual languages presented.</p>



<p><strong>Colossal:</strong>&nbsp;So many conversations about identity center ideas of multiplicity, of people not having a singular self. How do you see that relating to the face and to self-portraits?</p>



<p><strong>Bogojev:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly! I think this is what most artists nowadays are fully aware of and that is why they struggle to find the “right way” to create self-portraits or they create multiple versions of it. Again, I feel it’s the superficiality of selfie-culture that made them extra wary of how they present themselves without jeopardizing their integrity and practice. With their artwork being the most direct and honest way of communicating with the world, it is not easy for an artist to pick one image, or even concept, as a single representation of oneself. I think this is why the artists in ME built their self-portraits by layering different visuals (Van Minnen), assembling a variety of elements (Shiqing), creating an atmosphere they connect to (Flint, Toscani, Chapin), captured an intimate moment that describes them best (Erheriene-Essi, O’Brien).</p>



<p>ME is on view from January 16 to 30 at&nbsp;<a href="https://highlinenine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High Line Nine</a>&nbsp;in New York.
