<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p>This course has the ambition to build a bridge between a century of science and 21st-century managers. A bridge between how our brain works and how to use that knowledge to improve our communication and leadership abilities.</p>
<p>To understand how and why Leadership works, we first need to understand what triggers us. We’ll be diving deep into our subconscious motivational processes. We’ll have a look at our brain, call it our ‘hardware’ and the subconscious programs running in it, that’s basically our software.</p>
<p>So expect tools, concrete, and simple tools that you will be able to use right away with your team and colleagues. In the end, the aim of this course is to open the way for a new understanding of motivation and communication, towards a new, highly effective and sustainable model for leadership in this 21st century.</p>
<p>But most of all, by the end of this course, my aim is that you, as a manager, as a leader, will have understood what a crucial role you play in your team and in its success. And that you will be able to leverage that knowledge and guide your team to a new level of collaboration and engagement.</p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Neuroscience and Leadership" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cq4nUqEHiIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>I will provide a framework based on the latest insights in cognitive psychology and related fields. Within this framework, I will present your studies, research, and experiments on human behavior and I will show you how they apply to leadership and team management. </p>
<div class="audience__title">Who this course is for:</div>
<ul class="audience__list">
<li>Managers in charge of a team</li>
<li>Managers looking for tools and insights to manage their team</li>
<li>Professionals who want to improve their people skills</li>
<li>Professionals who want to learn more about human behavior</li>
</ul>

<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now more than ever, corporations are investing heavily in IT. The quality of these investments affects the daily work of millions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet it’s not uncommon to see industry surveys where the failure rates for IT projects is over 50%. It’s possible to do better and it’s possible to do so consistently. Use the Business Model Canvas to focus your company strategy and facilitate buy-in from stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Drive Digital Transformation With Platform Strategies | Info-Tech Analyst Perspective" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-X1ExlQ9uE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this two-week course, we’ll step through major challenges within corporate IT and how to address them with the disciplined use of design thinking, Lean Startup, and agile as a team framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translate your work on the Canvas to specific charters in IT. Rapidly prototype strategically-aligned processes for implementation within your IT infrastructure. How do you define a customer-centric strategy you can actually execute? To do strategic IT, you’ve got to have a strategy! Ideally, you need one that’s easy to understand and use as a clear basis for action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what you’ll learn in this course.</span></p>
<h3>A Short Description</h3>
<p>A customer-centric way of doing business is a way that provides a positive customer experience before and after the sale in order to drive repeat business, enhance customer loyalty and improve business growth.</p>
<p>But, a customer-centric company is more than a company that offers good service. Both Amazon and Zappos are prime examples of brands that are customer-centric and have spent years creating a culture around the customer and their needs. Their commitment to delivering customer value is genuine – In fact, Zappos is happy to fire employees if they do not fit within their customer-centric culture!</p>
<p>But, how important is being customer-centric? The good news is that’s becoming very important! Econsultancy recently asked what the most important characteristic is in order to establish a truly “digital-native” culture. The answer to that question and leading the responses with 58% was to be customer-centric. </p>
<p>Enroll in this course to find out.</p>

<h3>Course Description</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The objective of this course is to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Python 10-week course covers the basics of Python 3. The main lessons include Python Syntax and Semantics, Basic Programming Language, Computer Programming, Python Programming.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the course-wide materials as well as the first part of Chapter One where we explore what it means to write programs.

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web. JavaScript is easy to learn. This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.</p>
<h3>Examples in Each Chapter</h3>
<p>With our “Try it Yourself” editor, you can edit the source code and view the result.<br />
We recommend reading this tutorial, in the sequence listed in the left menu.</p>
<h3>Learn by Examples</h3>
<p>Examples are better than 1000 words. Examples are often easier to understand than text explanations.</p>
<p>This tutorial supplements all explanations with clarifying “Try it Yourself” examples.</p>
<p>If you try all the examples, you will learn a lot about JavaScript, in a very short time!</p>
<h3>Why Study JavaScript?</h3>
<p>JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML to define the content of web pages</li>
<li>CSS to specify the layout of web pages</li>
<li>JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages</li>
</ol>
<p>Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.</p>
<h3>Did You Know?</h3>
<p>JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.</p>
<p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.<br />
ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.</p>
<p>You can read more about the different JavaScript versions in the chapter JS Versions.</p>
<h3>Learning Speed</h3>
<p>In this tutorial, the learning speed is your choice.</p>
<p>Everything is up to you.</p>
<p>If you are struggling, take a break, or reread the material.</p>
<p>Always make sure you understand all the “Try-it-Yourself” examples.</p>
<h3>JavaScript References</h3>
<p>W3Schools maintains a complete JavaScript reference, including all HTML and browser objects.</p>
<p>The reference contains examples for all properties, methods and events, and is continuously updated according to the latest web standards.</p>
<p>Complete JavaScript Reference.</p>
