<p> When discussing gamification and game-based learning there is often some confusion as to how they differ. Many people use the terms interchangeably but they are not the same. However they are often linked together so it isn’t always easy to separate them. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Game-based learning and gamification have been around for a number of years at the elementary and high school level. More recently it has been making its way into higher education as it offers a number of benefits to students.</p></blockquote>



<h2>What is Game-Based Learning?</h2>



<p>Game-Based Learning or GBL is using a game as part of the learning process. Some examples of GBL could be using monopoly to teach the basics of money management or playing scrabble to help improve vocabulary skills. However, today when people talk about game-based learning they are usually referring to digital game-based learning. Game-based learning teaches through repetition, failure and the accomplishment of goals which is basically the way players become good at video games.</p>



<h2>What is Gamification?</h2>



<p>In education<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification_of_learning">&nbsp;gamification</a>&nbsp;is the introduction of game-like elements into the learning environment to help motivate students and make the process more engaging. This is accomplished by taking some of the elements that make games fun and that motivate people to keep playing and using those elements in a learning situation. Some examples of gamification include:</p>



<ul><li>Points/Badges : The use of points and badges provides tangible evidence of accomplishment</li><li>Immediate Feedback: Fast response to actions that are taken rather than waiting for a paper to be graded.</li><li>Levels/Quests: Provide missions and goals to be accomplished</li><li>Leveling Up: Indication of achievement and opening up of new missions, badges and activities</li><li>Collaboration/Teamwork: Accomplish a goal working with others</li></ul>

<p>High quality education can make all the difference in people’s lives. It helps individuals escape poverty, earn a promotion, or find better paid jobs. But getting a university degree or a training certificate often costs a lot of money, and strict class schedules clash with work shifts, preventing people from enrolling in educational programs. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Fortunately, online courses are providing a viable alternative for millions of people. And as a part of the thriving e-learning industry that will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/07/31/e-learning-climbing-to-325-billion-by-2025-uf-canvas-absorb-schoology-moodle/#60583d483b39">grow</a>&nbsp;to $325 billion by 2025, they’re no longer a fringe idea.  </p></blockquote>



<p>Instead, online courses are becoming increasingly popular, and there are many reasons why they’re&nbsp;<a href="https://richardvanhooijdonk.com/en/keynote/the-future-of-education/">the future of education</a>.&nbsp; </p>



<ol><li>Online learning offers convenience and flexibility</li><li>High-quality student-tutor interactions</li><li>Studying online is affordable for many people</li><li>All age groups benefit from online learning</li><li>More students can be enrolled</li><li>There’s a vast amount of online learning resources</li><li>Web-based learning will grow in popularity</li></ol>



<p><strong>Online learning offers convenience and flexibility</strong></p>



<p>Flexibility is one of the key reasons behind the growing demand for web-based learning. According to survey results published&nbsp;by the university ranking website Best Colleges, 59% of students who enroll in online education programs have children and 50% of them are employed. They highly value the opportunity to study when they can, as lectures are typically archived for later reference, making compulsory campus attendance a thing of the past. Also, they can work faster or slower on course material, depending on their current needs and understanding of the subject matter.</p>



<p><strong>High-quality student-tutor interactions</strong></p>



<p>Another advantage of&nbsp;<a href="https://thetrendsnext.com/technology-is-redefining-education-heres-how/">online education</a>&nbsp;is improved communication between students and tutors. A study by California State University in San Bernardino<a href="https://www.nitrocollege.com/blog/online-college/why-online-education-better">found</a>&nbsp;that although people who study online absorb knowledge equally well as those who go to class, they’re more active in discussions and enjoy a better interaction with instructors. Technologies such as video conferencing and VOIP calls make it easy to communicate with people across the world. Online students also benefit from more frequent assessments, with professors able to spot knowledge gaps faster and provide suggestions on how to move forward.</p>
